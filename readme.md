## Overview
This project is a feature display website on two brands that I currently am a part of. The purpose of this website is to display the three main features of the aforementioned brands. The landing page will allow you to choose which brand's features you would like to see. Clicking on a button will direct you to the features display that also shows GIFs of what you will see in those brands. The technology used in this website is HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Key Components
